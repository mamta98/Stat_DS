Please use the Data.xlsx file to investigate the effect of independent variables (price per square foot, number of bathrooms, and floor size) on the price of a high-floor, spacious 2-bedroom house with a spectacular view, available at an affordable price. The null hypothesis (H0) states that there is no significant effect of the independent variables on the price. The alternative hypothesis (H1) suggests that there is a significant effect of the independent variables on the price. The objective is to test this hypothesis using the provided data in the "Data" Excel file.
 
Selection of Confidence Level: A 95% confidence level is chosen to determine the range within which the true parameter value is likely to fall. A 95% confidence interval covers 95% of the normal curve, meaning that there is a 5% probability of observing a value outside of this range.

 Statistical Test or Model: To test the hypothesis, a multiple regression analysis is conducted. This analysis helps determine the relationship between the dependent variable (price) and the independent variables (price per square foot, number of bathrooms, and floor size).
